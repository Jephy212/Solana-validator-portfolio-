# Solana Validator Setup Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you set up and run your own Solana validator node, contributing to the network’s decentralization and security. No prior validator experience needed—just basic Linux knowledge and a willingness to learn.

---

## 1. Introduction

Validators play a crucial role in the Solana ecosystem by validating transactions and producing blocks. Running a validator not only supports decentralization but also helps protect the network from censorship and outages.

## 2. System Requirements

- **Hardware:**  
  - CPU: 12 or more cores (recommended)  
  - RAM: At least 128 GB  
  - Storage: 1 TB NVMe SSD (fast storage is important)  
  - Network: Reliable 1 Gbps connection with low latency  

- **Software:**  
  - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or a similar Linux distribution  

- **Skills:**  
  - Basic command-line proficiency  
  - Understanding of key management (public/private keys)

## 3. Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Update Your System

Open your terminal and run:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
text

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

sudo apt install -y curl git build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev
text

### Step 3: Install Solana Validator Software

Download and install the latest stable Solana release:

sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
text

Add Solana to your system PATH for easy access:

export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
text

### Step 4: Generate Your Validator Keys

Create your identity and vote account keys securely:

solana-keygen new --outfile ~/validator-identity.json
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/vote-account.json
text

### Step 5: Start Your Validator Node

Run the validator with your keys and connect to the Solana mainnet:

solana-validator 
--identity ~/validator-identity.json 
--vote-account ~/vote-account.json 
--entrypoint entrypoint.mainnet-beta.solana.com:8001 
--ledger ~/solana-ledger 
--rpc-port 8899 
--expected-genesis-hash 5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdp 
--expected-shred-version 49491 
--dynamic-port-range 8000-8020 
--limit-ledger-size
text

## 4. Security Best Practices

- **Keep your keys safe:** Store your identity and vote keys offline or in a secure location.  
- **Stay updated:** Regularly update your validator software to benefit from the latest features and security patches.  
- **Monitor your node:** Use monitoring tools to track uptime and performance to ensure your validator runs smoothly.  
- **Backup regularly:** Keep backups of your ledger and key files to prevent data loss.
